WORDCLOUD CHARACTERISTICS CHANGES

In dataplicity type:
su wordcloud
(enter password - wordcloud)
sudo nano /home/wordcloud/WordCloud/WordCloudGenerator.py

Find the following section in the code to alter Wordcloud refresh rate, word length and word density.
   
    print("Generating wordcloud...")
    # create wordcloud using data
    wordcloud = WordCloud(
        background_color="white", height=300, width=400,
        include_numbers = True, min_word_length=5, # minimum length of word
        max_words = 15, margin = 4 # margin between words
    ).generate(data)
    
To alter the E-Ink refresh rate edit:
        time.sleep(1800)

 ******************************************************************************
 AUTO RUN ON STARTUP
 
 This is done using systemd
There are two start-up files:
wordcloud.service
Startup.service

 To edit this file go:
 sudo nano etc/systemd/system/wordcloud.service
 
 Once saved run the following:
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo systemctl start wordcloud.service		This runs the run.sh file
 sudo systemctl enable wordcloud.service	This enables the service file to run on startup


To debug itâ€™s useful to look at:
 sudo systemctl status wordcloud.service

		
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TO TURN OF AUTO RUN
 
 sudo systemctl stop wordcloud.service		This stops the service file running in terminal
 sudo systemctl disable wordcloud.service	This stops the service file running on startup
 

 ******************************************************************************
GENERAL PROCESS

The run.sh file executes everything.
1. WordCloudGenerator.py .. This reads the contents.txt file, generates a wordcloud, dithers the image to make it E-Ink compatible and finally publishes it to the display.
2. AzureSpeechCC (C#) ..... This launches the speech to text service. The recognized phrases are published to the contents.txt file. The individiual words are send to the PiOLED via a pipe.
3. write_to_oled.py ....... This opens the pipe with AzureSpeechCC and prints the words to the display.
4. reset_button.py ........ This runs a script that deletes the contents.txt file when a button is pushed.
5. WifiStatusLED.py ....... This runs a script to light an LED when connected to the internet.


******************************************************************************
