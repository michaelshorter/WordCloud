# WordCloud


  ******************************************************************************
ADD NEW WIFI CREDENTIALS

To add a wifi network to the WordCLoud follow the instructions on this link:
https://linuxconfig.org/ubuntu-20-04-connect-to-wifi-from-command-line


1. First step is to identify the name of your wireless network interface. To do so execute:

$ ls /sys/class/net
enp0s25  lo  wlp3s0

Depending on your Ubuntu 20.04 system the wireless network interface name would be something like: wlan0 or like in this case it is wlp3s0.

2. Next, navigate to the /etc/netplan directory and locate the appropriate Netplan configuration files. The configuration file might have a name such as 01-network-manager-all.yaml or 50-cloud-init.yaml.

$ ls /etc/netplan/

3. Edit the Netplan configuration file:
4. 
$ sudoedit /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml

and insert the following configuration stanza while replacing the SSID-NAME-HERE and PASSWORD-HERE with your SSID network name and password:
Make sure that the wifis block is aligned with the above ethernets or version block if present. The entire configuration file may look similar to the one below:

network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2
    wifis:
        wlp3s0:
            optional: true
            access-points:
                "SSID-NAME-HERE":
                    password: "PASSWORD-HERE"
            dhcp4: true

4. Once ready, apply the changes and connect to your wireless interface by executing the bellow command:

$ sudo netplan apply

su wordcloud
(enter password - wordcloud)
sudo nano /home/wordcloud/WordCloud/AzureSpeechCC/Program.cs

Now comment/uncomment the language you want using // and delete the // infront of the languages you do not want. Other languages can be added in here easily - see the full list here.


var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(YourSubscriptionKey, YourServiceRegion);
        // Swiss German
        //speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "de-CH";
        // German
        //speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "de-DE";
        // English
        speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "en-US";

WORDCLOUD CHARACTERISTICS CHANGES

In dataplicity type:
su wordcloud
(enter password - wordcloud)
sudo nano /home/wordcloud/WordCloud/WordCloudGenerator.py

Find the following section in the code to alter Wordcloud refresh rate, word length and word density.
   
    print("Generating wordcloud...")
    # create wordcloud using data
    wordcloud = WordCloud(
        background_color="white", height=300, width=400,
        include_numbers = True, min_word_length=5, # minimum length of word
        max_words = 15, margin = 4 # margin between words
    ).generate(data)
    
To alter the E-Ink refresh rate edit:
        time.sleep(1800)


Now press the following keys to save and exit the editor    
Control + o
Enter
Control + x


 ******************************************************************************
 AUTO RUN ON STARTUP
 
 This is done using systemd
There are two start-up files:
wordcloud.service
Startup.service

 To edit this file go:
 sudo nano etc/systemd/system/wordcloud.service
 
 Once saved run the following:
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo systemctl start wordcloud.service		This runs the run.sh file
 sudo systemctl enable wordcloud.service	This enables the service file to run on startup


To debug itâ€™s useful to look at:
 sudo systemctl status wordcloud.service

		
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TO TURN OF AUTO RUN
 
 sudo systemctl stop wordcloud.service		This stops the service file running in terminal
 sudo systemctl disable wordcloud.service	This stops the service file running on startup
 

 ******************************************************************************
GENERAL PROCESS

The run.sh file executes everything.
1. WordCloudGenerator.py .. This reads the contents.txt file, generates a wordcloud, dithers the image to make it E-Ink compatible and finally publishes it to the display.
2. AzureSpeechCC (C#) ..... This launches the speech to text service. The recognized phrases are published to the contents.txt file. The individiual words are send to the PiOLED via a pipe.
3. write_to_oled.py ....... This opens the pipe with AzureSpeechCC and prints the words to the display.
4. reset_button.py ........ This runs a script that deletes the contents.txt file when a button is pushed.
5. WifiStatusLED.py ....... This runs a script to light an LED when connected to the internet.


******************************************************************************
KNOWN BUGS

1. The WordCloud needs fairly good internet to run >5MBs. The below error appears when poor internet is used (I think...)

	Encountered error.
	Error code: 6
	Error details: Due to service inactivity, the client buffer exceeded maximum size. Resetting the buffer. SessionId: 120c01025c574f85b5df0285ff8fdd97
	Session stopped.

2. Sometimes not all processes start on boot.

3. Program crashes when mic is unpluged and plugged back in.
